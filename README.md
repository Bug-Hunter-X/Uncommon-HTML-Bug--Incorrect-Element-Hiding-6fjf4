This repository demonstrates a subtle but uncommon bug in HTML related to hiding elements. The bug involves the misuse of the CSS `visibility` property when attempting to hide an element.  The `visibility: hidden;` style keeps the element's space allocated, while `display: none;` removes it from the layout completely. This example shows both the incorrect and correct approaches, highlighting the difference in behavior.
